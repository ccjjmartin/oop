Object Orientated Programming

My notes from:

PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice
By Matt Zandstra

Also contains a self created exercise:

Your mission should you choose to accept it, will be to go undercover in Conglomerate Inc. this monstrosity loves to gather data, all kinds of data, data from everywhere.  The big boss "El Jefe" has instructed everyone at the company to find ways to add more content to the website.  In order to work your way up the corporate ladder you must design a system that is object orientated in php, easy extensible in the future, and is able to accept the following file types: text files, yml files, and for those of you zealous enough twitter feeds.  You will need to provide basic coverage using php unit testing.  As always, should you or any of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. This recording will self-destruct in five seconds. Good luck!
