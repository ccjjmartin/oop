Object Orientated Programming

My notes from:

PHP Objects, Patterns, and Practice
By Matt Zandstra

## Scripts:
If you wish to run any scripts run them from the project root directory using
the syntax bash scripts/<script>

## Exercise #1:

Your mission should you choose to accept it, will be to go undercover in
Conglomerate Inc., this monstrosity loves to gather data, all kinds of data,
data from everywhere.  The big boss "El Jefe" has instructed everyone at the
company to find ways to add more content to the website.  In order to work your
way up the corporate ladder you must design a system that is:

1) Object orientated in php

2) Easily extensible in the future

3) Able to accept the following file types:
  a) Text files (csv)
  b) Yaml files (yml)
  c) For the zealous enough ... twitter feeds.

4) You will need to provide basic coverage using php unit testing.

As always, should you or any of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary
will disavow any knowledge of your actions. This recording will self-destruct in
five seconds.

Good luck!
